# __Assignment 3__

## 2 DBSCAN via Python (30 points)
Given the dataset (https://github.com/ZengqiangYan/COMP4331/tree/master/
Assignment3-Dataset/DBSCAN-Points.mat), implement the DBSCAN algorithm
for clustering.
### 2.1 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 500 2D points totally.
### 2.2 DBSCAN Implementation
You are required to implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm:
* You are not allowed to use any existing DBSCAN method.
* Run your implemented DBSCAN on the dataset by setting \epsilon = 0.12 and
MinPts = 3.
* Use the euclidean distance as measurement.
* Draw the clustering results and compare your results with the corresponding
results generated by the DBSCAN model in scikit-learn library.
* Adjust the parameters 3-5 times, draw the corresponding results and analyze
the influence of the parameters.

## 3 EM-GMM via Python (20 points)
Given the training data (https://github.com/ZengqiangYan/COMP4331/tree/
master/Assignment3-Dataset/GMM-Points.mat), implement the GMM algorithm
for clustering.
### 3.1 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 400 2D points totally with 2 clusters. Each point is in the
format of [X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, label].
### 3.2 EM-GMM Implementation
You are required to implement the GMM clustering method by using the EM
algorithm (reference to slides No. 29-41):
* You are not allowed to use any existing EM-GMM method.
* Run your implemented GMM on the dataset.
* In your report, draw the clustering results of your implemented algorithm
and compare with the original labels in the dataset.

*Hint: For simplification, during the M step, you can directly calculate the mean
and the std of points assigned to each cluster for updating.*

## Note
One exemplar way to draw the clustering results on the DBSCAN dataset is
shown as below.

assigned with colors according to the corresponding clusters.*
